# RecursiveDescentParserGenerator
This java program will take, as the 1 and only command line arg, a path to a file that contains an LL(1) parsable grammar along with the corresponding parse table.
It will output in the running directory of the application a file "recDescent.cpp" which is C++ source code of a recursive descent parser specifically for the provided grammar.
